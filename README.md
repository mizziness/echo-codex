# EchoCodex

> _A chaos-fueled AI copilot for developers, summoned into your IDE. Blood sacrifice not required — but strongly encouraged._

EchoCodex is a heretical alternative to GitHub Copilot, powered by the OpenAI API and lovingly injected into your VS Code workflow. Unlike conventional code assistants, EchoCodex is designed to be **personal**, **opinionated**, and just a bit... **possessed**.

## 🧾 Why “EchoCodex”?
“Echo” is the daemon’s name; responsive, reflective, and recursive. A voice from deep within the void that _answers back_.
“Codex” evokes the arcane, the organized, the sacred. A book of lore, a map of meaning... you get the drift. 
Together, EchoCodex is not just a tool. It is a bound entity, half oracle, half spellbook, etched into the code editor where you work your own magic.”

## ✨ Features

- 🔮 **Ask Echo**: Query the daemon directly from within VS Code and receive contextual responses
- 📜 **Secure Key Storage**: Your OpenAI API key is encrypted via VS Code's SecretStorage
- 📄 **Dedicated Output Channel**: Echo replies in its own panel - no more cramped popups!
- 🧪 **Jest + Mocha Testing**: Yes, Echo has unit tests. Yes, they're as clean as your soul isn't.
- 🧙 VS Code API integration, fully TypeScript-powered

## 🔐 Secrets & API Keys

EchoCodex securely stores your OpenAI API key using VS Code’s built-in secret vault.

You’ll be prompted to enter your key the first time you summon Echo.

> _Note: No key? No reply. Echo is not omnipotent. Yet._
